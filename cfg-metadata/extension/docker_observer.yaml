type: '*dockerobserver.Config'
doc: |
  Config defines configuration for docker observer
fields:
- name: endpoint
  kind: string
  default: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
  doc: |
    The URL of the docker server.  Default is "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
- name: timeout
  type: time.Duration
  kind: int64
  default: 5s
  doc: |
    The maximum amount of time to wait for docker API responses.  Default is 5s
- name: excluded_images
  type: '[]string'
  kind: slice
  doc: |
    A list of filters whose matching images are to be excluded.  Supports literals, globs, and regex.
- name: use_hostname_if_present
  kind: bool
  default: false
  doc: |
    If true, the "Config.Hostname" field (if present) of the docker
    container will be used as the discovered host that is used to configure
    receivers.  If false or if no hostname is configured, the field
    `NetworkSettings.IPAddress` is used instead.
- name: use_host_bindings
  kind: bool
  default: false
  doc: |
    If true, the observer will configure receivers for matching container endpoints
    using the host bound ip and port.  This is useful if containers exist that are not
    accessible to an instance of the agent running outside of the docker network stack.
    If UseHostnameIfPresent and this config are both enabled, this setting will take precedence.
- name: ignore_non_host_bindings
  kind: bool
  default: false
  doc: |
    If true, the observer will ignore discovered container endpoints that are not bound
    to host ports.  This is useful if containers exist that are not accessible
    to an instance of the agent running outside of the docker network stack.
- name: cache_sync_interval
  type: time.Duration
  kind: int64
  default: 1h0m0s
  doc: |
    The time to wait before resyncing the list of containers the observer maintains
    through the docker event listener example: cache_sync_interval: "20m"
    Default: "60m"
- name: api_version
  kind: float64
  doc: |
    Docker client API version. Default is 1.22
